GENERAL SUMMARY

I updated the SpreadSheetServer to handle multiple clients concurrently with an event-driven architecture. When the server socket is ready to accept a new connection, it accepts a new connection and adds it to the set of connections. Then, the server polls all active connections to determine those that are ready for reading. It handles one operation from each client whose socket is ready for reading. All sockets are polled using the select system call with a 0 second timeout.

NOTE: I also updated the client and server sockets to use the TCP_NODELAY option. This diables Nagle's buffering algorithm which massively increases the performance of our spreadsheet server.
